I had to use low amounts a forests and couldn't use cross validation because it too much time:

import sklearn as sk
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
df.head()


df.dropna()
df.isnull().sum().all()

X = df.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = df['Class']


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=3, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)


pred = rf.predict(X_test)
score = rf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(score)

x1 = [0,10]
y1 = score
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(x1, y1, width=1, edgecolor="white", linewidth=0.7)
plt.show()
